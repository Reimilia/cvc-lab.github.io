**100-step open-loop rollouts across 8 physical systems.**
Blue = PHAST (Known), Green = PHAST (Partial), Red = GRU, Gold = S5, Purple = LinOSS, White = ground truth. PHAST tracks ground truth where baselines diverge.

### TL;DR

We embed the port-Hamiltonian energy structure $\dot{x}=(J{-}R)\nabla H(x)$ into a neural architecture that decomposes dynamics into potential $V(q)$, mass $M(q)$, and damping $D(q)$. Across 13 benchmarks spanning 6 physical domains, this structure alone yields the best long-horizon stability — outperforming S5, GRU, Transformers, and other baselines by up to $10^5\times$.

### Abstract

Real physical systems are dissipative — a pendulum slows, a circuit loses charge to heat — and forecasting their dynamics from partial observations is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. We address the _position-only_ ($q$-only) problem: given only generalized positions $q_t$ at discrete times (momenta $p_t$ latent), learn a structured model that (a) produces stable long-horizon forecasts and (b) recovers physically meaningful parameters when sufficient structure is provided.

The port-Hamiltonian framework makes the conservative-dissipative split explicit via $\dot{x} = (J - R)\nabla H(x)$, guaranteeing $dH/dt \le 0$ when $R \succeq 0$. We introduce **PHAST** (Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics), which decomposes the Hamiltonian into potential $V(q)$, mass $M(q)$, and damping $D(q)$ across three knowledge regimes (KNOWN, PARTIAL, UNKNOWN), uses efficient low-rank PSD/SPD parameterizations, and advances dynamics with Strang splitting.

Across thirteen $q$-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors. We show that identification is fundamentally ill-posed without such anchors (gauge freedom), motivating a two-axis evaluation that separates forecasting stability from identifiability.

### Three Knowledge Regimes, One Template

PHAST unifies three levels of prior knowledge under a single port-Hamiltonian template. The architecture is identical across regimes — only the component instantiations change.

**KNOWN** — $V(q)$: given from physics | $M(q)$: given from physics | $D(q)$: _learned_ (PSD) | Identifiable
_E.g., pendulum, RLC circuit, Lennard-Jones, heat exchange_

**PARTIAL** — $V(q)$: template + learned $\tilde{V}$ | $M(q)$: given | $D(q)$: _learned_ (bounded) | Partially identifiable
_E.g., double pendulum, N-body gravity, cart-pole_

**UNKNOWN** — $V(q)$: neural network | $M(q)$: neural SPD net | $D(q)$: neural PSD net | Not identifiable
_E.g., predator-prey, black-box dynamics_

**Shared across all regimes:** port-Hamiltonian state $x=(q,p)$ with conservative-dissipative split | passivity guarantee $dH/dt \le 0$ by construction | Strang-split symplectic integration | causal velocity observer for $q$-only input

### Key Insight: Forecasting ≠ Identifiability

![Windy Pendulum, Double Pendulum, and Cart-Pole system schematics](../../../images/projects/phast/system_schematics.png)

These three systems form a progression of structural complexity: **Windy Pendulum** (1-DOF, scalar damping $d(\theta)$), **Double Pendulum** (2-DOF chain with configuration-dependent mass $M(q)$), and **Cart-Pole** (mixed topology $\mathbb{R} \times S^1$, per-DOF damping with two distinct mechanisms: constant cart friction $d_c$ and position-dependent angular wind damping $d(\theta)$).

A model that forecasts well need not recover the true physics — damping $D(q)$ can act as a "stabilizer" absorbing errors in $V$ or $M$, making the inverse problem **non-identifiable** without sufficient structure. PHAST exposes this via two evaluation axes:

- **Forecasting** — rollout MSE at $H{=}100$: PHAST (PARTIAL) achieves the best forecasting across all three systems
- **Identifiability** — damping $R^2_D$ vs. ground truth: PHAST (KNOWN) achieves near-perfect recovery ($R^2_D \approx 1$) on Pendulum and Double Pendulum

Baselines (S5, LinOSS, VPT) do not expose explicit damping fields — they can forecast, but cannot tell you _why_ the system dissipates.
